# formatblock

This extension helps in formatting the code within the blocks. This extension will add new lines in the block so that can be easily read and understood by the developer. This helps in debugging the code as the code will not look congested.

## Features

This function can be used either calling Format Block from the command palete or on auto save.

Code examples before and after formatting

```
const test = () => {
  const first = '1';
  const second = '2'
  const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  }
  add(first, second);
}
```

after

```
const test = () => {
  const first = '1';
  const second = '2'

  const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  }

  add(first, second);
}
```
